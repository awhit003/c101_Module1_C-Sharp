TWiT.tv - Coding 101
Join Father Robert Ballecer and Lou Maresca on Coding 101, a weekly instructional, project-oriented programming show with appeal for beginning to intermediate programmers. Using a combination of classroom-style teaching, guest programmers, and special interest segments, Coding 101 will offer beginner, intermediate and "applied" programming topics within several interchangeable modules. Learn programming languages such as Java, C++, Visual Basic, and more!

Although the show is no longer in production, you can enjoy episodes from the TWiT Archives.
